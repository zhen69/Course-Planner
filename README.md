# Course Planner
Implemented a simple course planner that permits users to plan out their schedules.

##Description
Students often face the situation of creating their course schedule for the next semester or school year. One might have trouble picking the right course due to their major requirements, interests, and course difficulty/time. Hence, this project would serve the purpose of a planner where individuals could write down all the courses they are interested in taking and remove the least important/interesting classes recursively until a schedule is obtained.

<b>Functionalities offered by the Planner:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Add/Remove a Course.</li>
  <li>Filter by Department.</li>
  <li>Search.</li>
  <li>Create backup planners.</li>

<h3>Executing program</h3>
Run directly in IDEs
Or
Do the following in the terminal (the following example is run in the Windows PowerShell):

  If a error is presented, download Java from <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/">Orcale</a>
  
  <li>Check if you can access the Java compiler</li>
  ```
  C:\Users\anon> javac
  ```

  If not, Follow the steps on <a href="http://www.skylit.com/javamethods/faqs/javaindos.html">this site</a>
  
  <li>Change the directory to the one that contains your Java files. Let's call this directory "JavaProgram"</li>
  ```
  C:\Users\anon> cd JavaProgram
  C:\Users\anon\JavaProgram>
  ```
  
  <li>Compile the file you want to execute. Let's call this file "RunMe.java"</li>
  ```
  C:\Users\anon\JavaProgram> javac RunMe.java
  ```
  This will create the class file "RunMe.class"

  <li>Run the program</li>
