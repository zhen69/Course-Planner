# Course Planner
Students often face the situation of creating their course schedule for the next semester or school year. One might have trouble picking the right course due to their major requirements, interests, and course difficulty/time. Hence, this project would serve the purpose of a planner where individuals could write down all the courses they are interested in taking and remove the least important/interesting classes recursively until a schedule is obtained.
